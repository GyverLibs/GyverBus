# GyverBus
Library for communication via GBUS protocol
- Very simple, reliable, noise and latency resistant, but slow UART-based communication interface
- Two-way communication over one wire
- Asynchronous send and read (based on millis())
- Two-way compatible with hardware UART
- Ability to send and receive data within the Arduino network
- Addressing up to 254 devices on the network (from 1 to 255)
- Omnivorous send and receive function (eats variables, structures, arrays)
- Built-in CRC check (continuity check) of the data packet
- Ability to send and read a short "request"
- All Arduino-compatible boards are supported
- The library itself provides debugging capabilities (error codes)
- In the examples there are compact options for reading and sending data, it will even fit into ATtiny

### Compatibility
Compatible with all Arduino platforms (using Arduino functions)

### Documentation
The library has [extended documentation](https://alexgyver.ru/GyverBus/)
